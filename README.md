# ClonalFrameML_scripts
scripts for inferring recombination sites with ClonalFrameML


Until I can figure out how to output PhyML files to a specified path, you must execute the automate_CFML.py script in the working directory containing the input file(s). Note the input is fasta, not xmfa. I use a core genome multi-fasta file as input.
